## Creation of predictive models for the analysis of emotion from audio files

This project aims to create predictive models of emotions from audio files using, where necessary, Spark libraries for parallelization of work.

### How to run
We suggest you to use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for ease of use.

Download the 'notebooks' and 'dataset' folders and upload them in your Google Drive. Check if the path of the dataset is correct, modifying, if necessary, the following line:
```python
base_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/dataset'
```
Each of the notebook blocks is adequately commented to guide the user through the code.
Select the notebook you want to test and run it.
